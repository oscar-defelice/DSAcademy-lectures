# DSAcademy-lectures
Here is the material for a course I will be giving in a Master of Data Science and AI for junior Data Scientists.

This is somehow a prequel of the other modules on 
1. [Statistical Learning](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/ML-lectures)
2. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DeepLearning-lectures)
3. [Time Series](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/TimeSeries-lectures)
4. [Computer Vision Hands-On](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/Computer-Vision-Hands-on)

## Install requirements
As usual, it is advisable to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
One can follow [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and the suitable section according to the OS.

Once the virtual environment has been set up, one has to run the following instruction from a command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all the packages the code in this repository needs.

## Interact with notebooks

You can use _Binder_, to interact with notebooks and play with the code and the exercises.
