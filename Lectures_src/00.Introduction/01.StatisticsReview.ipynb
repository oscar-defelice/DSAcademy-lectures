    "Supervised machine learning algorithms can be split into two groups based on the type of target variable that they can predict:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification** is a prediction task with a categorical target variable. Classification models learn how to classify any new observation. This assigned class can be either right or wrong, not in between. A classic example of classification is the iris dataset, in which you use physical measurements of plants to predict their species. A famous algorithm that can be used for classification is logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression** is a prediction task in which the target variable is numeric. A famous example of regression is the Housing Prices problem we have mentioned above. In this machine learning contest, one tries to predict the sales prices of houses based on numerous independent variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "The left part of this image is a classification. The target variable is the shape of the observation, which is a categorical variable. The right part is a regression. The target variable is numeric. The decision rules could be exactly the same for the two examples, but their interpretations are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single prediction, classifications are either right or wrong, while regressions have an error on a continuous scale. Having a numeric error measure is more practical, so many classification models predict not only the class but also the probability of being in either of the classes."

    "\n",
    "The aim of this section (with no surprise) is to introduce the basic concepts of statistics.\n",
    "In particular we are going to focus very rapidly on the basics (random variables, distributions, etc.), applying the hopefully previous knowledge to some exercise, then we move forward to the theoretical basis of machine learning, _i.e._ Statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can summmarise the content of this section,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basics\n",
    "    - Probability measure\n",
    "    - Distributions\n",
    "    - Mean, median, variance\n",
    "* Relations between quantities\n",
    "    - Collinearity\n",
    "    - Correlation\n",
    "* Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Significance\n",
    "* Statistical inference\n",
    "    - Bayesian inference\n",
    "    - Frequentist inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to start we give a definition of __statistics__.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to say it as _a great expert of statistics_,\n",
    "> _63 statistics over 100 are false. This included._\n",
    "\n",
    "In applying statistics to some context, it is conventional to begin with a so-called _statistical population_ or a _statistical model_ to be studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "_e.g._ We want to study among all people in this class, how many are blonde.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: __descriptive statistics__, which summarise data from a sample using indexes such as the _mean_ or _standard deviation_, and __inferential statistics__, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). We will focus on the latter, however, we are going to give a brief description of few useful concepts of the former. \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.\n",

    "### Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of gathering data and evaluating the claim with a goal to _reject_ or _failing to reject_ the claim is termed as hypothesis testing.\n",
    "Note the wordings – “failing to reject”. It means that we do not have enough evidence to reject the claim. \n",

    "\n",
    "__Null Hypothesis__: A general statement for a statistical theory that suggests there is no statistical significance exists between the populations under attention. Denoted as $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Alternative Hypothesis__: This suggests there is a significant difference between the population parameters. It could be greater or smaller. Basically, it is the contrast of the Null Hypothesis. Denoted by $H_1$.\n",

    "_Example_  Let's consider an example. We want to test the equality of average means ($\\mu$) of two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* for a two-tailed test, we define $H_0$: $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2$ and $H_1$: $\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Level of significance__: Denoted by $\\alpha$. It is a fixed probability of wrongly rejecting a _True Null Hypothesis_. \n",
    "For example, if $\\alpha=5\\%$, that means we are okay to take a $5\\%$ risk and conclude there exists a difference when there is no actual difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Critical Value__: Denoted by $C$ and it is a value in the distribution beyond which leads to the rejection of the Null Hypothesis. It is compared to the test statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Test Statistic__: It is denoted by $t$ and is dependent on the test that we run. It is deciding factor to reject or accept Null Hypothesis.\n",
    "The test statistic measures how close the sample has come to the null hypothesis. Its observed value changes randomly from one random sample to a different sample. A test statistic contains information about the data that is relevant for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "Different hypothesis tests use different test statistics based on the probability model assumed in the null hypothesis. Common tests and their test statistics include:\n",

    "|  ANOVA  | F-statistic   |    \n",
    "|  $\\chi^2$-test | $\\chi^2$-statistic   |    \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the sample data must provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the effect exists in the population. Ideally, a hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis when the effect is not present in the population, and it rejects the null hypothesis when the effect exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>$p$-value</b>: It is the proportion of samples (assuming the Null Hypothesis is true) that would be as extreme as the test statistic. It is denoted by the letter $p$.\n",
    "The p-value (short for probability value) is the most critically viewed number in statistics. It is defined as the probability of receiving a result at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. My favourite description of the p-value in simple words is the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.\n",

    "Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of sampling. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.\n",
