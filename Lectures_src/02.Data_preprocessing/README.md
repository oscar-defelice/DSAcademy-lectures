# Data preprocessing

This module is about data pipelines, data preprocessing and techniques to encode non-numerical features.

Pandas is a great tool to make data analysis. With such a weapon, we are going to face some problems and try to have hints useful to apply machine learning algorithms in the proper way.

We are going to talk about _data preprocessing_ the mixed blessing of all data scientists.
