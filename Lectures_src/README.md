## [Introduction](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/00.Introduction) 🎒

Here we collect the introductory arguments for this course. In this lectures, we illustrate the general working scheme of a _Machine Learning model_, explaining the main categories of automated learning _i.e._ 

 - supervised learning
 - unsupervised learning
 - reinforcement learning

 Furthermore, we explore the main differences between predictive tasks of _classification_ and _regression_.

Hence, we show a first example of predictive model: _linear regression_. 
Finally, we also focus on the general lifecycle of a Data Science model.

## [Pandas and data visualisation](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/01.Pandas) 🐼

In this section we introduce one of the most famous basic tools for data analysis.
Furthermore, we focus on visualisation and simple data manipulation to extract insights from data.

In particular, we play with pandas dataframes, filters and matplotlib plots.

## [Data pipeline and data treatment](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/02.Data_preprocessing) 📊

This module is about data pipelines, data preprocessing and techniques to encode non-numerical features.
In particular we build our first data pipeline, trying to extract features to feed a machine learning model properly, guided by Exploratory Data Analysis.

## [Supervised classifier](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/03.Supervised_learning) 🦾

## [Supervised regressor](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/03.Supervised_learning) 🦿

## [Regularisation](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/04.Regularisation) 🌊

## [Software and Tools](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/05.Software_tools) 🔧

This lecture is aimed to introduce some powerful tools:

- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/) for data visualisation and dashboards.
- [Git and GitHub](https://www.github.com/) for code versioning and collaboration.

## [Time Series](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/06.Time_series) ⌛

We illustrate methods to perform time series analysis and decomposition. 
We give also mention of techniques to time series forecast.

## [Unsupervised learning](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/07.Unsupervised_learning) 🤖

## [Ensemble methods](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/08.Ensemble_methods) 🌳

## [Final project](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/09.Final_project) 🖼️

The proposed final project is an application of what we have seen in the course of the lectures.

The idea is to build a whole pipeline from data collection to prediction.
