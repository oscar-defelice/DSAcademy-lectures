## [Introduction](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/00.Introduction)

Here we collect the introductory arguments for this course. In this lectures, we illustrate the general working scheme of a _Machine Learning model_, explaining the main categories of automated learning _i.e._ 

 - supervised learning
 - unsupervised learning
 - reinforcement learning

 Furthermore, we explore the main differences between predictive tasks of _classification_ and _regression_.

Hence, we show a first example of predictive model: _linear regression_. 
Finally, we also focus on the general lifecycle of a Data Science model.

## [Final project](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures/Lectures_src/09.Final_project)

The proposed final project is an application of what we have seen in the course of the lectures.

The idea is to build a whole pipeline from data collection to prediction.
