Until now, we have explored _supervised learning algorithms_, i.e. we were in the presence of "right answers" labelling training data.

Now, we want to focus on _unsupervised learning algorithms_, and in particular on the class of _clustering_ algorithms.

We do not have labels on data, and we look for a way to put together data and make the algorithm assign them to a same class.

## Clustering

The main example of unsupervised learning algorithm is the class of clustering algorithms.
The main goal of _cluster analysis_, or clustering, is the automatic discover of natural grouping in data.

In is an unsupervised learning task because, unlike supervised learning (like predictive modelling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.

There are several example of clustering techniques, based on distance or on point density in space. We are going to present two examples:

1. [$k$-means](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DSAcademy-lectures/tree/master/Lectures_src/07.Unsupervised_learning/01.Clustering.ipynb)
2. [DBSCAN](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DSAcademy-lectures/tree/master/Lectures_src/07.Unsupervised_learning/02.DBScan.ipynb)
