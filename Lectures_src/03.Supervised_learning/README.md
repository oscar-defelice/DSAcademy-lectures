# Supervised Learning

In this lecture we focus on supervised learning problems.

We will explore the two main classes of such models: _regression_ and _classification_ tasks.

## [Regression problems](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DSAcademy-lectures/blob/master/Lectures_src/03.Supervised_learning/01.Regression.ipynb)

These are commonly referred to the prediction of _continuous_ values. We will frame the problem as a supervised learning task building training couples and training a model on them.

## [Classification problems](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DSAcademy-lectures/blob/master/Lectures_src/03.Supervised_learning/02.Classification.ipynb)

These are the classical "assign objects to sets" problems. We are going to see how to predict probabilities of belonging to a certain class and defining a _decision rule_ for the assignment.

## [Error metrics](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DSAcademy-lectures/blob/master/Lectures_src/03.Supervised_learning/03.ErrorMetrics.ipynb)

We need to define a metric to measure how good is our model response. We examine the most suitable metrics for different tasks and introduce the concepts of _satisfying_ and _optimising_ metrics.

## Aside note

To mix you up, we suggest to read this evergreen medium post titled "[_There is no classification_]((https://towardsdatascience.com/there-is-no-classification-heres-why-bdc8539bc898)) by the Head of Decision intelligence department at Google.
Really inspiring and interesting in any case.
