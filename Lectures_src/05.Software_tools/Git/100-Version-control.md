# What is version control?

Version control systems are software that help you track changes you make in your code over time.
As you edit to your code, you tell the version control system to take a snapshot of your files.
The version control system saves that snapshot permanently so you can recall it later if you need it.

Without version control, you are tempted to keep multiple copies of code on your computer.
This is dangerous. It is easy to change or delete a file in the wrong copy of code, potentially losing work.
Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of your code but presenting you with a single version at a time.

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.
In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

Benefits:

    - Create workflows
    - Work with versions
    - Code Together
    - Keep a history
    - Automate tasks

It can be _local_ or _remote_ (online or on a local network).
We are going to explore the use of git further on.
