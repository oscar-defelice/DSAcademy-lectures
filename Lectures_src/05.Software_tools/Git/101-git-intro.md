## Distributed vs. Centralized

Git is a distributed version control system, it means your local copy code is a complete version control repository!

You work on your code locally (commit) and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on some server, or some local network.

In centralized version control you must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code !

## git vs github ?

First of all, let us state an important fact: [Git is _not_ GitHub](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13321556/difference-between-git-and-github).
Git is the version control tool, often used by a command line environment. Github is one of the tools that you can use to sync git repositories.

Basically, GitHub is a service provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control based on Git.
A huge number of open-source projects are hosted on GitHub repositories, included these lectures.

## Why open source practices and principles matter?

[Because none of us is smarter than all of us](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/virtual-machines/linux/)

### Plenty of professional organisations are using it

[Look at Microsoft Account in github](https://github.com/microsoft/)

[Talke a look at Octoverse website](https://octoverse.github.com/)
