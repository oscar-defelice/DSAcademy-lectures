They are called CART trees (Classification and Regression trees) and instead of containing a single decision in each “leaf” node, they contain real-value scores of whether an instance belongs to a group. After the tree reaches max depth, the decision can be made by converting the scores into categories using a certain threshold.\n",

    "\n",
    "typical values: 1–10\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `subsample` - fraction of the training set that can be used to train each tree. If this value is low, it may lead to underfitting or if it is too high, it may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "typical values: 0.5–0.9\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `colsample_bytree` - fraction of the features that can be used to train each tree. A large value means almost all features can be used to build the decision tree.\n",

    "typical values: 0.5–0.9\n",
    "\n",
    "The above are the main hyperparameters people often tune. \n",
