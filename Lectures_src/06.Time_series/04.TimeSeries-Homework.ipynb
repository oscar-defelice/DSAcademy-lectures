    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare (within a single plot) the monthly trends of\n",
    "\n",
    "* electric energy consumption\n",
    "* renewable energy production (solar, wind and the sum of the two).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the yearly trend of the ratio between\n",
    "\n",
    "* renewable energy production\n",
    "* electric energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyse the trend in solar energy production starting from $2012$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare, starting from $2006$, the trends in\n",
    "\n",
    "* solar energy production\n",
    "* wind energy production\n",
    "* total production of renewable energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Import and plot the time series [`alcohol_sales`](datasets/alcohol_sales.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the series decomposition.\n",
    "2. Plot the components and try to describe them\n",
    "3. Analyse residual distribution and try to find out if they follow a normal, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Import and plot the time series [`co2-ppm`]('https://pkgstore.datahub.io/core/co2-ppm-daily/co2-ppm-daily_csv/data/f2f91444294eec9f764430483fafc6be/co2-ppm-daily_csv.csv'). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to plot the series and decompose it.\n",
    "2. Find the distribution of the residual part. Does it follow a Gaussian curve?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5\n",
    "Forecast and represent the solar energy production of $2017$, by using years from $2012$ to $2016$ as training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should use at least 2 different models and compare results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Import, plot and analyse the time series of [Italian covid cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/master/dati-andamento-nazionale/dpc-covid19-ita-andamento-nazionale.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to plot at normal and log scales the new cases, hospitalised and deaths. What can you say?\n",
    "2. Find the _lag of maximum correlation_ between the series of new cases and deaths to determine how delayed is one curve with respect to the other.\n",
    "3. Taking a forecast window of 3 weeks, try to forecast the new cases tomorrow. Think of what metric is the most suitable to use."
